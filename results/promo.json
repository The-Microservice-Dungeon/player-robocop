  "detailsInfo": "Suggests replacing classes with records.\n\nThe inspection can be useful if you need to focus on modeling immutable data rather than extensible behavior.\nAutomatic implementation of data-driven methods, such as equals and accessors, helps to get rid of boilerplate.\n\n\nNote that not every class can be a record. Here are some of the restrictions:\n\n* A class must contain no inheritors and must be a top-level class.\n* All the non-static fields in class must be final.\n* Class must contain no instance initializers, generic constructors, nor native methods.\n\nTo get a full list of the restrictions, refer to the\n[Oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se15/preview/specs/records-jls.html).\n\nExample:\n\n\n      class Point {\n        private final double x;\n        private final double y;\n\n        Point(double x, double y) {\n          this.x = x;\n          this.y = y;\n        }\n\n        double getX() {\n          return x;\n        }\n\n        double getY() {\n          return y;\n        }\n      }\n\nThis record will be converted to:\n\n\n      record Point(int x, int y) {\n      }\n\nThis inspection only reports if the language level of the project or module is 15 preview or higher.\n\nNew in 2020.3",
